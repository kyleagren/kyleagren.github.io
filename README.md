# kyleagren.github.io

This is a project made as part of an application for a job at BYU OIT.

Included are the 3 files needed to run the code, alternatively you can just navigate to kyleagren.github.io to encounter the running product. 

I left a few comments in there but most of it got cleaned up as I got things working how I wanted them to. 

I spent 3 hours on the challenge, started at 10:50 ish in the morning and finished the coding portion a few minutes ago. Just cobbling together the repo, etc. 
at this point. 

I think if I had a bit more coding experience I would have tried to clean up the logic for determining the winner since it's a bit ugly in its current state.
However it works and that's what I'm happiest about. 

There is some repeated code in there that I'm not the happiest about, namely a long chain of if statements, but I couldn't figure out a better way to do it.
